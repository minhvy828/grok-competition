### About this project
\
I am participating in a Web Competition on Grok Learning for students on which everyone needs to style a given HTML, and this is my preview for my submission.
\
\
In this Web Competition, I was given a HTML as a skeleton for an online candle stored called 'The Fire Within'. I need to use my web design skills and css to style the page and compete with others' design.
\
\
Voters need to compare two designs, side-by-side, and pick the one they like the most. The winner design will be decided by its win rate. I won this tournament as first place with the win rate of 84% against hundred of student worldwide.
